# Task-01: 
## Basic REST API with CRUD Operations 

### Create an API with endpoints to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a users resource.
- Each user should have fields: id (UUID), name, email, and age.
- Use an in-memory data structure (like an hashmap or object) for storage.
- Ensure proper status codes and error handling (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests).
- Include basic input validation (e.g., checking if email is valid).
